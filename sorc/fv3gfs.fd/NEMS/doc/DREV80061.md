Description
-----------

This milestone is a check to ensure that the components running as
part of a system within NEMS produce the same results as the
components running stand-alone. To accomplish this, the Whole
Atmosphere Model (WAM), the Ionsphere-Plasmasphere Electrodynamics
(IPE) model, and the 
\ref sw_mediator "space weather mediator"
are run side by side within the NEMS system without exchanging
fields. The output of the IPE component of this system is compared to
a stand-alone version of IPE from before it was incorporated into
NEMS. The output of the WAM component of this system is compared to a
version of WAM running stand-alone within NEMS.  This is a technical
(non-scientific) milestone.

\todo reference wam and ipe in the above paragraph

In this milestone both model components run for 1 hour starting at
1/15/2009. The WAM component runs on a global 3D reduced Gaussian grid
(\ref GRID_wam "WAM grid"). The horizontal resolution is T62. The
vertical component of this grid is 150 levels in pressure with a
maximum height of approximately 800 km. The IPE component runs on an
80 x 170 flux tube grid (\ref GRID_IPE "IPE grid") that extends up to
approximately 360,000 km.

NUOPC "caps", which are essentially wrappers for the coupling
interface, are provided for the WAM and IPE components allowing them
to work in NEMS and other NUOPC-compliant systems. For example, the
"IPE cap" allows the IPE model to work as a part of the NEMS system.

Build & Run

Instructions on how to build and run specific code revisions
(e.g. this milestone revision) and the supported compsets are provided
on the WAM-IPE Build & Run page.

\todo reference WAM-IPE Build & Run page.

Run Sequence
------------

The NEMS run-time configuration for the side by side WAM-IPE system is
provided below.  For details on the run sequence in general please
refer to the 
\ref configuring
and

The stand-alone version of IPE wasn't run within NEMS, so it doesn't
have a run-time configuration. The NEMS run-time configuration for the
stand-alone WAM run is provided below.

Validation
----------

The validation procedure for this milestone is to compare output files
from the IPE and WAM components running within a side by side WAM-IPE
NEMS system to versions of the components running stand-alone. The
following subsections describe the results for both components.

A test report is available for the validation run:

### IPE

To verify that IPE is running correctly within NEMS we compare the
output files from a stand-alone version of IPE from before it was
incorporated into NEMS to the current version running in a side by
side WAM-IPE NEMS system. This comparison is done using the UNIX cmp
command. This command compares files byte by byte to ensure that they
are identical. The files being compared are plasma information files
(plasma00 - plasma16), and electodynamics information files (fort.2000
- fort.2010). See the results of the comparison below. Given that the
files produced by the two versions are identical, the conclusion was
that IPE running within the WAM-IPE system is behaving the same as the
stand-alone version.

### WAM

To verify that WAM is running correctly within NEMS we compare the
output files from WAM running stand-alone to WAM running in a side by
side WAM-IPE NEMS system. This comparison is done using the unix cmp
command. This command compares files byte by byte to ensure that they
are identical. The files being compared are flux files (flxf00 &
flxf01), surface files (sfcf00 & sfcf01), and sigma files (sigf00 &
sigf01). See the results of the comparison below. Given that the files
produced by the two versions are identical, the conclusion was that
WAM running within the WAM-IPE system is behaving the same as the
stand-alone version.

| File Name |  File Source 1  |     File Source 2  |  Number of Bytes Different |       Status |
| :-------: | :-------------: | :----------------: | :------------------------: | :----------: |
| flxf00 |      Stand-alone WAM |     WAM within side by side WAM-IPE |                 0 |       OK |
| flxf01 |      Stand-alone WAM |     WAM within side by side WAM-IPE |                 0 |       OK |
| sfcf00 |      Stand-alone WAM |     WAM within side by side WAM-IPE |                 0 |       OK |
| sfcf01 |      Stand-alone WAM |     WAM within side by side WAM-IPE |                 0 |       OK |
| sigf00 |      Stand-alone WAM |     WAM within side by side WAM-IPE |                 0 |       OK |
| sigf01 |      Stand-alone WAM |     WAM within side by side WAM-IPE |                 0 |       OK |

### Limitations and Technical Notes

This milestone is purely a verification that the individual components
are running correctly within the WAM-IPE system. Because no fields are
being exchaged, this system shouldn't be expected to behave as a fully
coupled system.
