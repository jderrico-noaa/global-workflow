/**@page milestones Milestone Revisions

The pages in this section relate to development milestones for NEMS
applications. The pages' titles include a revision number, application
name, and milestone number. A revision prefix indicates whether it is
a branch (DREV) or trunk (R) revision. New development occurs on a
code repository branch. Stable branch versions are merged back to the
repository trunk.

Web pages include the purpose of the milestone, grids, run duration,
validation, and other information.
