=========================================================

This is the source directory for the NEMS component of NEMS-based
modeling systems.  It:

* Employs ESMF superstructure & utilities
* Separate dynamics, physics, and coupler grid components &
  import/export states
* Digital filtering capabilities added
* Adiabatic (dynamics only) simulation capability
* Enhanced postprocessing capability

Most documentation that was in this file is now in the doc/
subdirectory, or in the app-level doc/ directory.  This documentation
is automatically combined into a single HTML file when runs `make` in
the doc/ subdirectory.
